# iRacing Controls Editor

This app allows for out-of-sim editing of the `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\iRacing\
controls.cfg` file, and the car-specific files, `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\iRacing\setups\*\controls.cfg`. If a car-specific file doesn't exist (indicated by the faded color & `+` icon), the main `controls.cfg` will be copied and saved into the appropriate folder upon clicking save (`Ctrl+s`).

Prior to saving any `controls.cfg` file, a back-up file called `controls.cfg.bk` is created in the relative folder if no backup file already exists.
